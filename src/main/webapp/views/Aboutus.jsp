		We are a growing Texas-based company and we got
		 our start by selling books five years ago from our garage.
		  We love to read and discovered that we could share our hundreds of books
		   with others by selling them online. Our goal is to give a second life to our
		    books by getting them in the hands of readers across the globe. Since then,
		     we've more than doubled our inventory each year, allowing us to expand to our
		      warehouse in Houston. Our inventory is currently well over 300,000 books and 
		      we sell on 10 different online marketplaces with more being added regularly. 
		      We also have a second warehouse in London. During the current recession, 
		      we've proudly been able to increase our staff and hire 80 new employees.	</h3></div>
